# Risav Karna

@risavkarna is a developer who co-created and co-coordinates the following systems and github organizations.

## covidsim.team

[covidsim.team]("https://www.covidsim.team") is research team in the field of covid. It has identified certain software services necessary to build and use.

## nep.work team

nep.work is a development team that works with covidsim.team, NAAMII, i-ikigai and Meraki.

## cosys.work

cosys.work is a development platform that provides nep.work like collaborative systems. CoSys primarily consists of archetypes of collaboration systems that can be used within the CoPlanetary ecosystem.

## coplanetary.work

coplanetary.work are cross planetary business process optimization services. This network is infinitely scalable.

## Modular Architecture

The system is composed of the following 4-8-16 divisions.

### Concepts (Econs, Covidonomics, Orgs)

Concept packages define the behavior of a certain system semantics. These definitions are both technical and human-friendly.

### Companies (Business, Startup, Enterprise)

A set of socioware systems with a financial and legal interface.

### Indviduals (Id, Groups, Labels)

A non-representation of a set of representation id generators that provide unique hyper-graphical addresses.

### Event Schedulers (Emails, Business Processes, Contracts)

A control system and dashboard for scheduling of events of all kinds including digital and virtual.

### Event Ontology (Categories, Temporality, AsyncAnarchy)

A recording system of all commonly known semiotic descriptors and algebraic structures.

### YAM & IAM

Identity and De-identity cards and keys generators produce key cards for identification and de-identification.

## Example

Unit Budgeting

- Business Day
- Off Day
- Contactless Interaction
- Identity

Unit Focus Cost
- Time
- Relation
- Meaning
- Behavior

Every day is a business day. Calculate its cost.

- Wake Up Scheduling (Morning Schedule)
- Work Start Scheduling (Time and Requirement)
- Work Transport (Vehicle, Petrol+Parking etc, Clothing & Protections)
- Entrance Booth Workflow (Sanitization, Office Storage, Sandboxing)
- Entry Protocol (Scan card, eyes-face-DNA, digital footprint)
- Exit, Transport Optimization, De-Work

Work Software requirements. All of it is confidential.
